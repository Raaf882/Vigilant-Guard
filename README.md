## About Vigilant Guard

Vigilant Guard is a website for file upload, scanning, and generating reports that inform users if the file is clean or infected. 
In Ransomware detection, we use a hybrid approach (signature-based and anomaly-based) leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques.


## Project Summary
In the face of increasing cyber threats, especially ransomware, which is one of the most dangerous viruses globally and significantly impacts Saudi Arabia, we developed a proactive solution to detect file infections by this virus.
We designed a website for file upload, scanning, and generating reports that inform users if the file is clean or infected. In Ransomware detection, we use a hybrid approach (signature-based and anomaly-based) leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques ðŸ’».

## Key Features
- Signature-Based Detection: We compiled a comprehensive database containing the most known ransomware hashes. If an attacker attempts to alter the virus hash, it can still be detected using machine learning based on the virus's behavior and characteristics.
- Anomaly-Based Detection: Using machine learning, particularly the Random Forest model, our solution identifies ransomware based on its behavior and properties, ensuring high accuracy.
Our model demonstrated very high accuracy and was trained on 150,000 records of data, contributing to us achieving this outstanding grade.
